# 266-Mid-Term
This is the repository for my mid-term project, Named QSouls.
It involves applying some basic Dark Souls mechanics to Quake.
The objectives are as follows:


Three main points:

 	(complete)   -Enemy deaths give souls
 	(incomplete) -When player dies, a bloodstain is left with souls (only one at any given time)
  	(incomplete) -Add a universal melee

Additionally, common deliverables are as follows:

 	(complete) -Separate Project Folder
 	(complete) -A README file describing how to play your mod
 	(complete) -A shortcut that automatically launches your mod
  	(complete) -User Interface updates to reflect the changes made to the game

How to play:

	Play Quake as normal, and observe the Dark Souls addittions!
	Souls are gained and represented in the armor element in the gui (armor cannot be seen)
	Listen for the sound changes
