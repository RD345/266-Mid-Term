# 266-Mid-Term
This is the repository for my mid-term project, Named QSouls.
It involves applying some basic Dark Souls mechanics to Quake.
The objectives are as follows:


Three main points:

 	-Enemy deaths give souls
 	-When player dies, a bloodstain is left with souls (only one at any given time)
  	-Add a universal melee

Additionally, common deliverables are as follows:

 	-Separate Project Folder
 	-A README file describing how to play your mod
 	-A shortcut that automatically launches your mod
  	-User Interface updates to reflect the changes made to the game

How to play:

	-Play Quake as normal, and observe the Dark Souls addittions!
